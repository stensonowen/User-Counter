# User-Counter
A Python script to collect statistics from various subreddits on a daily basis. Written May 2014


This is a tool I wrote one weekend in Python to track statistics available on certain subreddits. Most subreddits show the number of "readers" (subscribers) and "users here now" (subscribers who have visited in the last 15 minutes). This program used regular expressions to locate these numbers in the page's html (which it retrieved with mechanize, a python library) and saved them to a database using SQLite3. It polled both stats from /r/funny, /r/askscience, /r/TodayILearned, /r/gonewild, /r/FirstWorldAnarchists, /r/BuildAPc, /r/DataIsBeautiful, /r/CalvinAndHobbes, /r/SixWordStories, and /r/ExplainLikeIAmA roughly once an hour (there are occasional gaps where the retrieval failed; I deliberately left this unresolved to avoid repeatedly polling reddit when it was under heavy usage). This program ran on a Raspberry Pi to avoid leaving a computer on 24/7. I intended to run this program for only a week and graph the results (which are attached), but forgot to disable it afterward when I retrieved the initial information, so it ran for three months (exactly, by coincidence). This meant running 1965 times, resulting in almost 40,000 data points. These are enclosed as an excel file (as well as the original database).
